# Pong in C

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Pong in C using the ncurses library.
It's a terminal game against a CPU opponent. It's also my first project in C.

### How to play
Move the left paddle using 'W' and 'S'.

### How to run
To run the game, you need to have the ncurses library installed. Then just compile the code (gcc example):
```bash
gcc pong.c -o pong -lncurses
```
And run it:
```bash
./pong
```
